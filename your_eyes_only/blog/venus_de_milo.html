            <p>we thought the internet would solve loneliness. as technology advanced, we thought it might bridge the gap between people - between languages. <em>perhaps one day,</em> we thought, <em>it would even bridge the gap between species.</em></p>

            <p>in early twenty-twenty, the limits of that theory were tested. people were thrust into complete isolation. and what we saw was that technology didn't make us <em>less</em> lonely - but perhaps even more lonely than before. as conspiracy proliferated, people lost empathy, connection, and a reason to care for others. instead, people used any form of communication they had to argue, to fight. all of the good that technology had accomplished was undone, and people are loneliner now than ever.</p>

            <p>your eyes only is a collection inspired by this idea. it's inspired by the CLAMP manga <em>chobits</em> and the story called <i>a city with no people</i> which appears in the manga.</p>

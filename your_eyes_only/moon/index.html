                <p>The waxing crescent moon rises early in the afternoon during daylight hours, and it sets early in the evening. Often we refer to the New Moon as the phase when the moon rises and sets with the sun, and is therefore not visible in the night sky; however, many cultures recognize the first sliver of the waxing crescent as the New Moon.</p>
                <p>This “early rising” phase can be associated with: growing energy, setting goals, and learning something new.</p>
